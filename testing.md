## Validator testing

To validate all of our pages we went through all the validators and validated every available page of the website. CSS stylesheets is the only exception here considering I only have 1 CSS stylesheet and you only need to validate the stylesheets available.

### HTML validation

To validate our HTML we used the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and placed each individual page 

A couple of problems found within the validations cause by how allauth created the forms, these can be safely ignored. 
Home page

Membership checkout page

Unable to HTML validate membership page on deployed version, stripe integration cause this to not be possible. We instead used the page source for the deployed version.

### CSS validation

To validate our CSS stylesheet we used the [W3C Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

No problems found in our CSS validations

CSS Stylesheet
[CSS Stylesheet](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fpro-gainer-85d1fcf0b9b4.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### JSHint validation

To validate our Javascript we are using the [JSHint validator](https://jshint.com/)
Our JS validation went well, a few missing colons and warnings about variables. The warnings about variables can be safely ignored, these are variables like Stripe which is available however not declared so JShint acts up a bit.

calculate_membership_fees.js

![calculate_membership_fees.js validation](./static/images/testing/javascript_validator_calculate_membership_fees.PNG)

stripe_elements.js

![stripe_elements.js validation](./static/images/testing/javascript_validator_stripe_elements.PNG)


### Python validation

## Lighthouse testing

Using the chrome developer tools we did the lighthouse testing to give a general overview of the site quality, more about this [Here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview).

Each lighthouse test was done on incognito mode with the deployed version. Very high points overall, some points lost on performance specifically across the board. Points of performance were lost primarily from heroku delays, code imports and image loads. I had a look at the code imports like our CDN's if we could save some there, however there is no room to save. All imports are required across the website, the one potential saving is on Stripe which in theory is only used in the checkout page. Stripe documentation recommends for us to keep the imports globally available for their more advanced security features however so this will be left alone, security must always be prioritised over performance improvements.
