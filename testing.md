To validate all of our pages we went through all the validators and validated every available page of the website. CSS stylesheets is the only exception here considering I only have 1 CSS stylesheet and you only need to validate the stylesheets available.

### HTML validation

To validate our HTML we used the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and placed each individual page
